		<h1>WebIssues Java API</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>This library provides a simple object orientated API to the <a href="http://webissues.mimec.org/">WebIssues</a> team collaboration and issue tracking system. It currently
		supports all query operations, and a select number of write operations. The main omission is currently maintenance commands such as 
		editing projects, types and users</p>
		<p>The library was built using the provided API specification <a href="http://doc.mimec.org/webissues/server/protocol.html">here</a> and
		makes use of <a href="http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/">Commons HTTP client</a> for the underlying communications.</p>
		<h2>Using the API</h2>
		<h3>Making a connection</h3>
		<p>All interaction with the WebIssues server is handled by <a href="net/sf/webissues/Client.html">net.sf.webissues.Client</a> class.</p>

import net.sf.webissues.*;
import java.net.URL;

public class ClientExample {

    public static void main(final String[] args) throws Exception {
    	// Create a new client
        Client c = new Client();
        
        /* Configure the client. 2 things are required. First, the
           URL of the server itself */
           
        c.setUrl(new URL("http://mywebissuesserver.mycompany.com/webissues"));
        
        /* Now, an Authenticator call back. This will be invoked when
           authentication is required. The DefaultAuthenticator used
           here takes the username and password at construction, but you
           may provide you own Authenticator implementation if required */        
        
        c.setAuthenticator(new DefaultAuthenticator("myUsername","myPassword".toCharArray()));

        /* Now you can connect. As with all server operations, if you wish to
           monitor progress of the connection, or provide a way to cancel, you can
           provide you own Operation implementation */
        
        c.connect(new OperationAdapter());
        
        /* The client is now connected and the environment has been loaded. 
           This will dump out all projects, types and users to sysout */
        
        System.out.println(c.getEnvironment());
